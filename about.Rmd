Hi. My name is Sander Lamballais.

My promotors are prof. dr. [M. Arfan Ikram](http://www.erasmus-epidemiology.nl/people/profile.php?id=46) and prof. dr. [Henning Tiemeier](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/henning-tiemeier/).

My work focuses on the factors that shape cognitive function and brain structure across the lifespan.

Most of my work is focused on the [Generation R birth cohort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5233749/) and the [Rotterdam Study cohort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662692/).
